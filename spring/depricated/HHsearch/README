For parameters of hhsearch.py or hhfunctions.py
Run:
./hhsearch.py
./hhfunctions.py

Part 1 - Setup HHsearch (read HHsearch manual in hhsuite if neccessary)
 1. The directories blast, hhsuite and psipred are required to run the HHsearch Suite.
	You might need to reinstall these programs.
 1a. For more information on HHsearch read the readmen in ./hhsuite/README
 2. Update local pathes in source/HHsearch/hhsuite/lib/hh/scripts/HHPaths.pm ie:
	$execdir =
	$datadir =
	$ncbidir =
 
 3. Update hhsearchConfig.py (this is the configuration file for running hhsearch.py) the paths
	that may need to be changed are.
		hhsearchPATH: Full path to HHsearch directory (the diretory this readme file is in)
		hhsuiteDir: Full path to hhsuite directory
		uniprotDir: Full path to uniprot database directory
		uniprotDBName: Name of uniprot database contained in uniprotDir
		hhsearchDB: Full path to hhsearch database
		hhblits: Full path to hhblits executable
		hhmake: FUll path to hhmake executable
		hhsearch: Full path to hhsearch exectuable
		addss.pl: Full path to addss.pl script
 4. hhsearch.py handles the running and jobsubmission of the hhsearch scripts in the
	scripts directory. run ./hhsearch.py for parameters for running program.  Can
	also go to the example directory for examples
 5. hhfunctions.py contains helper functions for reading hhresults files and making models
	from hhsearch results. 

Directory Formats (each format is in the example directory) and Examples:
Complex (use -complex when running hhsearch)
  1. target directory should have the name chain1-chain2 ie 12asA-12asB
  2. the target diretories should have two sequences in fasta format. Using the
	name of the chain ie 12asA.seq and 12asB.seq
  3. Can run hhsearch.py locally by running
	./hhsearch.py -q 12asA-12asB -iDir /nfs/amino-home/bgovi/source/example/complex/ -make -search -complex
Monomer (use -monomer when running hhsearch)
  1. target directory should have be the name of the chain ie 12asA
  2. the target directorie should have one sequence in fasta format ie 12asA.seq
  3. Can run hhsearch.py locally by running
	./hhsearch.py -q 12asA-12asB -iDir /nfs/amino-home/bgovi/source/example/monomer/ -make -search -monomer
GenomeWide (use -genome when running hhsearch)
  1. The input directory will contain 3 directories: fasta, hhm and hhr:
	1a. The fasta directory will contain all of your sequence files
	1b. The hhm directory will contain all the target.hhm files
	1c. the hhr directory will contain all the target.hhr files
  2. Each path is dependant on the target name and the substrPosition and substrLength parameters in hhsearchConfig.py
  3a. Example paths.  If the target is 117eA and substrPosition = 0 and substrLenght = 2
	3a1 (full path to sequence file): /PathToInputDirectory/fasta/11/117eA.seq
	3a2 (full path to hhm file)     : /PathToInputDirectory/hhm/11/117eA.hhm
	3a3 (full path to hhr file)     : /PathToInputDirectory/hhr/11/117eA.hhr
  3b. Example paths 2. If the target is 117eA and substrPosition = 1 and substrLenght = 2
        3b1 (full path to sequence file): /PathToInputDirectory/fasta/17/117eA.seq
        3b2 (full path to hhm file)     : /PathToInputDirectory/hhm/17/117eA.hhm
        3b3 (full path to hhr file)     : /PathToInputDirectory/hhr/17/117eA.hhr
  3c. Example paths 2. If the target is 117eA and substrPosition = 2 and substrLenght = 3
        3c1 (full path to sequence file): /PathToInputDirectory/fasta/7eA/117eA.seq
        3c2 (full path to hhm file)     : /PathToInputDirectory/hhm/7eA/117eA.hhm
        3c3 (full path to hhr file)     : /PathToInputDirectory/hhr/7eA/117eA.hhr
  3d. The paths are made by getting a substring of the target based on the substrLengh and substrPosition parameters.
	Only the Full paths for the fasta directory are needed to be made. hhsearch.py will make the other paths are 
	hhmake and hhsearch results are being returned.


  2. This format is used for organizational puruposes when running hundreds to thousands of targets.	

TargetList and Batch Submission
  1.  The -q can also except a new line delimeted list of targets ie. -q /full/pathTo/TargetFile
        12asA
        12asB
        1a2sC
        16gsA
  2.  If running multiple targets to the cluster, the batchSize parameter in jobParameters in hhsearchConfig.py controls how many
	targets are ran per job.
