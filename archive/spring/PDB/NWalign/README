The NWalign directory contains the NWalign program
implemented in fortran NWalign.f.  A simple wrapper NWalign_wrapper.f
was written to allow it to be a callable function in python.  The
wrapper was converted into the shared library nwalign.so
using the f2py program.  Make sure f2py is installed in your version of python

If nwalign.so (which is the library function called by python) needs to be recompiled.
Due to use code on a different operating system.  In this directory run the command

f2py -c -m nwalign NWalign_wrapper.f

f2py can easily be googled.  Its a program that converts
fortran code into a python callable function.

align is a compliled version of NWalign.f
run ./align for explanation on how to run.

The nwalign.so is called by the module alignment.py in the function NWalign.
