The TMscore directory contains the TMscoreMod.f implemented in fortran.  This function
runs the TMscore superpostion algorithm.  This function was converted into the shared
library TMscoreMod.so so that its callable by python by the program f2py.  A simple 
wrapper NWalign_wrapper.Make sure f2py is installed in your version of python

If TMscoreMod.so (which is the library function called by python) needs to be recompiled.
Due to use code on a different operating system.  In this directory run the command

f2py -c -m TMscoreMod TMscoreMod.f

f2py can easily be googled.  Its a program that converts
fortran code into a python callable function.

This fortran function is used in the alignment.py Module by the function TMscore.
